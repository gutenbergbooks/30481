<h3>THE MAN THAT WAS A GHOST</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gold light across the golden coomb;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sun went west with horns of fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Athwart the sweet, sea-breathing room<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The swallows swooped; the village spire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glowed red against a gleam of broom;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While earth its scented secrets told,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There, silent, sunset-aureoled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sat Iol&auml;us, mild and old.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In distance large the moving ships<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sailed on into the evening skies.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span><span class="i0">He gazed, and saw not. In eclipse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tensely sat, like one who grips<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some semblance that his dream descries,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With such a look of far surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That half-uncanny seemed the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So warped with age, so weirdly wan:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He had such ghostly eyes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then half to self, and half to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Aloof in passion and lone despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke like one whose secrets flee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From silence unaware:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now plaintively from a grief gone blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heavy with cumbering care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, thrilling thought like a white sea-wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His words, the echoes of his mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Haunted the air:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">... 'Tis gone like the roses of long ago:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet a dawn's impassioned thrill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes blush the blossom's virgin snow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far on in a faery hill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two faces there in the glamour glow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In a place that is strangely still.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the rim of the world is a ruined tower<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sky-poised above wide sea-foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where a beautiful spirit waits hour by hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far-eyed 'gainst a dawn like a phantom flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till a ghostly lover comes home....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To leeward spread the freshening deep<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Purple beneath a rosy gleam.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Thin anthems to the orient beam<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span><span class="i0">Came faint as languid waves of sleep<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We sank our anchor solemnly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into that lustrous, splendid sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For we, that chased the summer's smile<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Across the world a wondering while,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hailed at the heart the Happy Isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The haunted shores of Fa&euml;ry!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beyond a gently-heaving brine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We broke with oars a trembling bay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swerving water, like rare wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Slid iridescent from our way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lovely hand was laid on mine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pensively as to say:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">To that grave glamourous place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, fearful of some far adieu,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I talked with one who never knew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The peril of her face.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The joy that lives is mightier far<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than foretaste of all grief unborn.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Enchanted still in echoing vales.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We lingered by the brightening shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We leapt upon the roseate strand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joy that in our hearts we bore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We loved, nor longed to understand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft siren voices evermore<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O, life was like a bird that sings<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At morning on a vernal bough!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The springtide at the heart of things<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sang as the spring knows how.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair was she, and both were young;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We knew not what made time so good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature with glamour-tutored tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Spread glory in the blood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We climbed the dim and dreaming streets:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Poised on a dizzy turret high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enfolded with the gorgeous sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We listened, she and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wonder, 'mazed. Without a word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A soul had spoken, soul had heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All suddenly came, charged with tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweetness of the human years.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We saw deep forests far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kindle to meet the kiss of day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mists with morn's delight uprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like love thoughts in a maiden's eyes.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">In regions whence the Ph&oelig;nix flew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dumb splendour round us blown, and higher<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Loitered the waning moon ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fond the hour; the scene so fair;<br /></span>

<p class="center bold">By</p>

<h3>JAMES A. MACKERETH</h3>

<p><i>Crown 8vo, 3/6 net.</i></p>

<h3>SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</h3>

<p><i>Westminster Review.</i>&mdash;We write under the conviction that Mr. Mackereth
is destined to compel the admiration not only of a few critics but also
of the general public.</p>

<p><i>Times Literary Supplement.</i>&mdash;He has a note of his own; one can always
enjoy the rich exuberance of his fancy and of his diction.</p>

<p><i>Daily Telegraph.</i>&mdash;A true singer whom no reader with a taste for
contemporary poetry should overlook.</p>

<p><i>Yorkshire Daily Observer.</i>&mdash;... We cannot afford to neglect such
poetry&mdash;it is vital... Alive with the spirit of the new century.</p>

<p><i>Aberdeen Free Press.</i>&mdash;The "Ode on the Passing of Autumn"... a really
splendid poem... Mr. Mackereth is undoubtedly a poet of considerable
power and originality.</p>

<p><i>The Literary World.</i>&mdash;There is a strength about his work which is very
rare in English verse.... Mr. Mackereth's name deserves to stand very
high among the poets of to-day.</p>

<p><i>The Star.</i>&mdash;"A Son of Cain"... is a good goad for the withered
imagination.... Why does Mr. Mackereth's poem "The Lion" flash the light
on our sickly glazed eyeballs? Its symbolism makes the soul wince and
tremble and ache.... The virtue in the poem sounds a spiritual tocsin.</p>

<p><i>Irish Times.</i>&mdash;... A note of his own, a passionate, vibrant note, but
true and strong.</p>

<p><i>Glasgow Evening Times.</i>&mdash;... A volume of singular insight and power.</p>

<p><i>Dundee Advertiser.</i>&mdash;... The title poem has the same haunting effect
upon the reader as "The Ancient Mariner." <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>The "Ode on the Passing of
Autumn" is a fine achievement.... We congratulate Mr. Mackereth on his
undoubted powers of sustainment.</p>

<p><i>The Daily Chronicle.</i>&mdash;His work is virile. His verse goes with a ring
and a tang.</p>

<p><i>The Scotsman.</i>&mdash;The title poem is a grim and powerful ballad.... The
book will be read with interest and admiration by all who value the
classic traditions of English poetry.</p>

<p><i>The Yorkshire Post.</i>&mdash;... He has the right to a place among those who
are creating the distinctive poetry of our time. In the two pieces, the
splendid "Ode on the Passing of Autumn," and "The Gods that Pass and Die
Not," Mr. Mackereth attains a height where splendid promise enlarges
into great performance.</p>

<p><i>The Bookman.</i>&mdash;... It proves him to be the possessor of a quick eye for
beauty, of imagination and sensitiveness. It repeatedly echoes great
work, yet still remains undeniably his own.</p>

<p><i>The Nation.</i>&mdash;What he has to say is vigorous and virile. He is not for
dealing in the vagueness of dissatisfaction, but endeavours to make his
writing an affirmation of joy.</p>

<p><i>The Glasgow Herald.</i>&mdash;To pass to his poems is to pass into mountain air
where sane thought dwells.... His heart is in poetry, and his own
pleasure in it merely as a word movement is manifest in every line of
such poems as "Mad Moll" and "Pan Alive."</p>

<p><i>The New York Times.</i>&mdash;A virile and hopeful singer ... resonant as a
trumpet-call to those who build the palace of life.</p>

<p><i>The Dial</i> (Chicago).&mdash;Clearly the work of a poet.... The volume will
well reward him who ventures into its pages.</p>

<p><i>Literary Digest.</i>&mdash;... The longer poems have a deep Atlantic roll....
In all his thought one can feel the lift of a tide.</p>

conception, and noble in its moral."</p>

line."</p>
